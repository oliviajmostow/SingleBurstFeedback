# SingleBurstFeedback
Code to support findings for "How Many Bursts Does it Take to Form a Core at the Center of a Galaxy?"

Simulation data and analysis scripts to produce the visualizations in [Mostow et al. (2025)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09566)

## Contents
### Figure 1 Data
"shmr_t.txt" and "tracer_t.txt" contain the output from "sg.py" found in the analysis folder, used to create the upper right portion of Figure 1.

### Figure 2 Data
Core radii (from fit_density.py) and inner log-slopes (from slope.py) for the models shown in Figure 2.

### Figure 3 Data
Similar to above, relevant slopes and core radii for the models shown in Figure 3.

### Figure 6 Data
Core radii and inner log-slopes for UFD/single-burst models shown in Figure 6.

### Analysis scripts/helper functions
Files containing helper functions for plots.  

### Visualizations
Scripts needed to produce Figures 1-6.
